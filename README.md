### What is this repository?
This repository contains the python code for BEAM's Project ECO-WISE (More about this on our [Wiki Page](https://github.com/dyka3773/data-analysis-ecowise/wiki/)) in order to compete in ESA's BEXUS competition.

### What are we doing in this project?
Our team is responsible for the Data Analysis of the project ECO-WISE. We are constructing a program which will be functioning live, during a weather balloon’s flight and will be analyzing the important data given by the Software Sub-team of ECO-WISE. Part of this program is the live display of some data regarding atmospheric parameters, internal experiment conditions and efficiency of some experiment’s components.

### What is the license of this project?
This project can be refactored and used by anyone whose goal is to analyze mass data taken from atmosphere flights, although we would prefer if they mentioned our project and our names.
