### Who are we?
We are a team of three undergraduate students working for one of BEAM’s projects. Our team consists of one Informatics Engineer and two Physicists.

### What is BEAM?
BEAM (Beyond Earth Aristotle Missions) is a student space technology team, based in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The idea of creating the team was conceived in April of 2018 by Aristotle University of Thessaloniki students. Students from various AUTH faculties form the team who are eager to apply their knowledge to new ideas and extend them to both theoretical and practical levels. ΒΕΑΜ, for the second consecutive year, wishing to reach the limits of outer space again, participates in BEXUS | 3031 with the experiment ECO WISE – Ecological COmputations With low-cost Set-up.

### What is project ECO-WISE?
The technical aim of the experiment is to create a device that maintains desired conditions for the operation of low-cost ground-based sensors for atmospheric measurements at space conditions during the flight of the stratospheric balloon. In the future this device can be used with different sensors for a variety of atmospheric measurements.
The main scientific aim of this project is to measure the concentration of two trace gasses, Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Ozone (O3), making a horizontal and a linear distribution of their levels during the balloon’s flight.

### What are we doing in this project?
Our team is responsible for the Data Analysis of the project ECO-WISE. We are constructing a program which will be functioning live, during the balloon’s flight and will be analyzing the important data given by the Software Sub-team of ECO-WISE. Part of this program is the live display of some data regarding atmospheric parameters, internal experiment conditions and efficiency of some experiment’s components.
